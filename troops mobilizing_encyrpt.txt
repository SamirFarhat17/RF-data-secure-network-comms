@ShoNuf77 @yqxo @Loukas_RS @APHClarkson That is too long. Russia would control most of Finland at that time and prevent Finnish troops from mobilizing.

@PolskiWariacik @Pangrowlin @SamRamani2 -mobilizing for training will take forever
-8-12 weeks training 
-then mobilize to the West, will also take forever
Ukrainians will know the entire NATO equipment until then 
- it is questionable how many Russian troops would be left in Ukraine.
This might take 4 -6 months

@free_libertaria Sure, but if ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º doesnâ€™t go for full societal mobilization, itâ€™s not clear how they can win at this point. Putin clearly doesnâ€™t want to do that or he would have done it. The Russian army is getting chewed up in the east and ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ isnâ€™t even done training the troops itâ€™s mobilizing.

@Vanda39560230 @SamDixonSA @PhillipsPOBrien Yes, that's the key question in my opinion: Is Putin doubling down. Mobilization would mean many months of preparing troops, and probably a war that lasts years. Actually I would be surprised if he doesn't go that route because not mobilizing means a strategic defeat.

@ebhodge If we accept that Donbass was a genocide against Russian-speaking Ukrainians by their own government then Russia May not have broken International Law solely by reason of mobilizing troops inside Ukraine. The Law of Genocide permits such actions. Read up on it.

@Garret_Beggan @CharlesAblett @andersostlund I do recall them mobilizing at the border if need be and to protect infrastructure and troops crossing from the Russian side. I never remember them saying they where going to cross over and join in. If you have a source saying otherwise please do share
